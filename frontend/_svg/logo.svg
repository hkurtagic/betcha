        This SVG defines a brand new logo for the "Betcha" Android application,
        designed to capture the essence of the phrase "hold my beer" without
        direct literal representation. It conveys confident prediction, decisive
        action, and a playful "gotcha" moment, suitable for a Kahoot-style
        betting app that involves no real-world transactions.

        The logo features:
        - A rounded square background with a vibrant, modern linear gradient,
          giving it an energetic and appealing look.
        - A central, stylized "snap" or "decisive click" motif, represented by
          radiating concentric rings. This symbolizes a quick, confident action
          or a moment of immediate confirmation.
        - A bold, dynamic checkmark positioned at the epicenter of the snap effect.
          This checkmark signifies a successful prediction, a confirmed bet, and
          the underlying "Betcha" confidence â€“ the "I told you so" moment.
        - The overall style is clean, abstract, and modern, aiming for high
          recognition and a distinct identity.

        Colors used:
        - Background Gradient: From a deep, rich violet (#673AB7) to a bright,
          energetic magenta (#E91E63), creating a dynamic and engaging backdrop.
        - Snap Rings & Checkmark: A vibrant, contrasting lime green (#CDDC39),
          chosen for its high visibility and playful energy, ensuring the core
          elements stand out.
